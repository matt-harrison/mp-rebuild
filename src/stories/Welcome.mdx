# Welcome to TIDE

> When building apps, one of the biggest challenges is to figure out if a piece of UI already exists in your codebase and how to use it for the new feature you're building.
>
> Storybook catalogues all your components and their use cases. Therefore, you can quickly browse it to find what you're looking for.
>
> Here's what the workflow looks like:
>
> * Use the sidebar to find the suitable component.
> * Review its stories to select the variant that fulfills the requirements.
> * Copy/paste the code snippet into the app and wire it up to data.
