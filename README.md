# TIDE Design System

TIDE (**T**rader **I**nteractive **D**esign and **E**ngineering) is a design system created and maintained by the TIDE Task Force of Trader Interactive's All-in Marketplace group, encompassing members of the Design, Development, and Product departments. It was initially developed for use in the `marketplace` repository, but can potentially be incorporated into further Trader projects, subject to the following technical restrictions:

1. CSS utilities can be leveraged by any Node-compiled project.
2. Types can be leveraged by any TypeScript project.
3. Basic components can be leveraged by any Vue 3 project.
